# Intrusion-Detection-System-Using-ML-DL
üìå Project Overview
As cyber threats continue to rise, this project focuses on developing a robust Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques. Trained on the NSL-KDD dataset, this system aims to effectively detect and classify malicious network activities in both binary (normal vs. attack) and multi-class (DoS, Probe, U2R, R2L) scenarios.
